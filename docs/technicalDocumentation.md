# Elysium Innovations' Interactive Pitch Deck - Technical Documentation

## Architecture

The application is divided into three main parts: the frontend, the backend, and the blockchain. The frontend is built with React.js and Redux, with UI components styled using Styled-Components and animations handled by Framer Motion. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, with data stored in either MongoDB or PostgreSQL. The blockchain integration is handled with Ethereum or Solana, using ERC-721 or ERC-1155 for NFT minting, and Web3.js or Ethers.js for interaction with the blockchain.

## Frontend

The frontend is structured around the Redux architecture, with actions and reducers defined in `actions.js` and `reducers.js` respectively. The main application entry point is `index.js`, which renders the `App.js` component. This component is responsible for rendering the main application layout and routing to different components based on the current URL.

The application is divided into several components, each responsible for a different part of the user flow:

- `Onboarding.js`: Handles the user onboarding process.
- `AgentMarketplace.js`: Simulates the agent marketplace.
- `TaskManagement.js`: Handles task delegation to AI agents.
- `PersonaCustomization.js`: Handles interaction with the NFT-based persona system.
- `SocialInteraction.js`: Provides a glimpse into future social functionalities.

UI components are defined in the `UI` directory, with `NavigationPanel.js`, `Animation.js`, and `InteractiveElement.js` providing reusable components for navigation, animations, and interactive elements respectively.

## Backend

The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, with routes defined in `userRoutes.js`, `aiRoutes.js`, and `nftRoutes.js`. These routes handle requests related to users, AI agents, and NFTs respectively. The corresponding controllers (`userController.js`, `aiController.js`, `nftController.js`) handle the business logic for these routes.

Data is stored in either MongoDB or PostgreSQL, with schemas defined in `User.js`, `AI.js`, and `NFT.js`.

## Blockchain

The blockchain integration is handled with Ethereum or Solana, using ERC-721 or ERC-1155 for NFT minting. The smart contract for the personas is defined in `Persona.sol`. Interaction with the blockchain is handled with Web3.js or Ethers.js, with utility functions defined in `web3.js`, `ethers.js`, `mint.js`, and `trade.js`.

## Infrastructure and DevOps

The application is containerized using Docker, with the `Dockerfile` defining the container configuration. Kubernetes is used for orchestration, with the deployment and service configuration defined in `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml` respectively. The application is hosted on either AWS or Google Cloud, with configuration defined in `aws/config.js` and `googleCloud/config.js` respectively. Continuous integration and deployment is handled with GitHub Actions, with the workflow defined in `main.yml`.

## Security

Security is handled with OAuth for authentication, JWT for session management, AES encryption for data at rest, and TLS for data in transit. Utility functions for JWT and AES are defined in `jwt.js` and `aes.js` respectively.

## Analytics

Analytics are handled with Google Analytics and Hotjar, with integration defined in `googleAnalytics.js` and `hotjar.js` respectively.

## Setup

To set up the application, clone the repository and install the dependencies with `npm install`. Then, start the application with `npm start`. For production, build the application with `npm run build` and start it with `npm run start:prod`.
